# Distance limits

Every fixed distance the app uses to decide something: when two points are the same place, how
far to search, when to warn. Look here before you add a new limit, and reuse one that means the
same thing.

Two points are compared in one of two ways:

- `isSameGoal(a, b, m = 10)` (`src/features/tours/domain/distance.ts`): straight-line distance
  in Swiss LV95 coordinates, `<= m`. Use it for "is this the same place".
- `haversineMeters(a, b)` (`src/core/utils/haversine.ts`): great-circle metres. Use it when the
  distance itself is needed (shown, sorted or summed).

The database uses `st_dwithin(geography, geography, m)`, which measures geodesic metres.

| `NEAR_M`       | 200 m | `tour-form.vue` (`fillPointsFromTrack`) | A picked GPX fills the empty start and end from its first and last point. A track end this close to the goal fills nothing, because it is the goal: a flight from the goal has no start, and a walk up to it has no end. The same 200 m makes a track a loop: when its ends lie this close together and the tour has a start, the end becomes the start. |
| `SAME_GOAL_M`  | 300 m | `point-suggestions.vue`                 | An earlier own tour whose goal is this close has the same objective. Its start or end (a landing for a flown way down) is offered first.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `SAME_PLACE_M` | 100 m | `point-suggestions.vue`                 | An end suggestion this close to the start is not offered. "Round Trip" already covers it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `AT_GOAL_M`    | 500 m | `point-suggestions.vue`                 | A public-transport stop this close to the goal is not offered as a start, because it is the summit's cable car or bus, so there is no way up. It is still offered as an end (the ride down).                                                                                                                                                             |
| `FAR_M`        | 20 km | `point-distance.vue`                    | A start or end farther from the goal shows its distance as a warning (`tours.form.farFromGoal`), for example a landing picked in the wrong valley.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Why 200 m for a track end but 500 m for a stop: a stop near the goal is a real place (the
station at the top), while a track end near the goal is the goal itself, off only by when the
recorder started and where the goal marker sits.
