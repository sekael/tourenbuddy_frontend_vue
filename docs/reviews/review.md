You do architectural code review of Vue 3 PWA.
No read every file. Navigate repo structure first, then
sample selective based on what find.

**IMPORTANT: Read-only review. Do NOT modify, create,
or delete any file. Only report findings.**

**Review scope (priority order):**
1. Architecture & module boundaries — check `src/features/` for
   DDD violations, circular deps, or leak domain logic into
   presentation
2. Spec conformance — check API calls, data models,
   request/response shapes in code match OpenAPI
   specs in `specs/`
3. Security — RLS surface, Supabase client usage, secrets/keys
   in non-.env files, unauthenticated route guards
4. State management — Pinia store patterns, reactivity misuse,
   missing error/loading states
5. PWA fundamentals — service worker strategy, offline handling,
   manifest completeness
6. Vue 3 best practices — Options vs Composition API consistency,
   defineProps/emits usage, v-model patterns

**What to read:**
- Top-level directory tree (1 level deep)
- `src/features/` tree (2 levels deep)
- `specs/` fully — read all spec files before touch any
  implementation code; build mental model of intended
  contract first
- One representative store, one repository, one service file
  (your choice based on tree)
- `src/router/index.ts` (auth guards)
- `vite.config.ts` + `vite-pwa` plugin config
- Any file named `supabase.ts`, `client.ts`, or similar DB init

**What NOT to read:** tests, `node_modules`, lock files,
auto-generated types, migration SQL files.

**Spec conformance — what to check:**
For each spec file found, cross-reference against matching
feature implementation and flag:
- Endpoints called in code but absent from spec (undocumented
  surface)
- Endpoints in spec with no corresponding implementation
  (unimplemented contract)
- Request payload shapes differ from spec (wrong field names,
  missing required fields, wrong types)
- Response payload shapes code assumes but spec does
  not guarantee (fragile destructuring)
- Error codes/states defined in spec not handled in
  store or repository layer
- Any RPC call whose signature or return shape differs from how
  code invokes or parses it

Only compare what actually readable in both spec and
sampled implementation files — no infer full coverage from
partial reads.

**Output format:**
For each finding, use this structure:
[SEVERITY: Critical/High/Medium/Low]
[CATEGORY: Architecture | Spec Gap | Security | State | PWA | Vue]
File: path/to/file.ts (line if known)
Spec: specs/filename.yaml (path + operation/schema if relevant)
Issue: one sentence
Why it matters: one sentence
Suggestion: concrete recommendation (do not implement this)

When review complete, write ALL findings to new file at:
`docs/reviews/code-review-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

Create any missing directories. File structure should be:

---
# Code Review — [date]

## Summary
[2–3 sentence overview of overall codebase health]

## Findings by Category

### Architecture

## Priority Action List
Top 5 findings to address first, ranked by severity and impact.

Do NOT print full findings to terminal. Print only
one-line confirmation once file written:
"Review complete — findings written to docs/reviews/code-review-[date].md"
