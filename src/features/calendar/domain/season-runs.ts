/**
 * Collapse a tour's (unordered, possibly-duplicated) tagged seasons into
 * contiguous runs over the fixed 4-season axis, so the Seasons view can draw
 * one spanning bar per run.
 *
 * Rules:
 * - Adjacent tagged seasons merge into a single run spanning their columns.
 * - An untagged season (a gap) always breaks a run — gaps are never bridged.
 * - Input order and duplicates don't matter.
 * - Winter and autumn are the two ends of the axis; they are NOT adjacent
 *   (no wraparound).
 *
 * Examples (over [winter, spring, summer, autumn]):
 * - `['spring','summer']`        → `[{ start: 1, span: 2 }]`
 * - `['winter','summer']`        → `[{ start: 0, span: 1 }, { start: 2, span: 1 }]`
 * - `['autumn','winter']`        → `[{ start: 0, span: 1 }, { start: 3, span: 1 }]`
 * - `[]` / `null`               → `[]`
