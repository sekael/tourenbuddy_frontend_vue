## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Persistent bottom-center tour action bar

The map page SHALL render a persistent action bar over the map, anchored bottom-center on both mobile and desktop viewports. The bar SHALL be a single rounded pill container with two tappable segments separated by a 1px divider in `--color-outline-variant`: a primary "My Tours" segment (Material Symbols `location_on` icon + label from `map.actionBar.myTours`) and a trailing icon-only Add-tour segment (Material Symbols `add_location_alt` icon, no visible label, accessible name from `map.actionBar.addTourAriaLabel`). The pill SHALL respect `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` and SHALL use the same glassmorphism surface tokens as `MapActionOverlay` (`--color-fab-surface`, `--shadow-md`, backdrop blur), with a 52px height and a border-radius of 26px (full pill).

#### Scenario: Bar mounted on map page

- **WHEN** the user opens the map page with no overlay active and `mapStore.isPickingLocation === false`
- **THEN** the bottom-center action bar SHALL be visible
- **AND** SHALL render a single pill with two segments in this DOM order: My Tours (text + icon), divider, Add-tour (icon only)

#### Scenario: Same layout on mobile and desktop

- **WHEN** the bar is visible on a viewport below 600px AND on a viewport at or above 600px
- **THEN** the bar SHALL be positioned bottom-center in both layouts using the same component instance and styling

### Requirement: Tour action bar visibility rules

The bar SHALL be hidden entirely while any of the following are true: `mapStore.isPickingLocation === true`, the tour info overlay is active, the tours list overlay is active, or the tour-creation overlay is active. The bar SHALL remain visible (with disabled segments) while any other top-level interaction is active — feedback / profile / contacts / friend-requests overlays, or the speed-dial menu / base-map sub-panel.

#### Scenario: Hidden during location picking

- **WHEN** `mapStore.isPickingLocation` becomes `true`
- **THEN** the bottom-center action bar SHALL be removed from the visible layout

#### Scenario: Hidden while tour info sheet is open

- **WHEN** the tour info overlay is mounted (mobile bottom sheet or desktop side drawer)
- **THEN** the bottom-center action bar SHALL be hidden

#### Scenario: Hidden while tour list sheet is open

- **WHEN** the tours list overlay is mounted
- **THEN** the bottom-center action bar SHALL be hidden

#### Scenario: Hidden while tour-creation dialog is open

- **WHEN** the tour-creation overlay is mounted
- **THEN** the bottom-center action bar SHALL be hidden

#### Scenario: Visible-but-disabled while a non-tour overlay is open

- **WHEN** the feedback, profile, contacts, or friend-requests overlay is open
- **THEN** the bottom-center action bar SHALL remain visible
- **AND** both pill segments SHALL render with a disabled visual state

#### Scenario: Tapping the disabled bar dismisses the active overlay first

- **WHEN** a modal overlay (bottom sheet on mobile, dialog or side drawer on desktop) is open
- **AND** the user taps either pill segment
- **THEN** the open overlay SHALL close
- **AND** the pill segment SHALL NOT additionally invoke its own action (no tours list opens, no pick flow starts)
- **AND** a subsequent tap with no overlay open SHALL invoke the segment's action normally

#### Scenario: Open speed-dial menu counts as an active interaction

- **WHEN** the speed-dial menu or its base-map sub-panel is open (no other overlay)
- **THEN** both pill segments SHALL render disabled
- **AND** tapping either segment SHALL close the speed-dial menu without invoking the segment's action
- **AND** the next tap (with the menu closed) SHALL invoke the segment's action normally

### Requirement: Tour action bar wires into existing flows

Activating the My Tours segment SHALL open the tours list overlay via the same code path used previously by the speed-dial entry (`activeOverlay === 'tours'`). Activating the Add-tour segment SHALL invoke `mapStore.setPickingLocation(true)` to enter the existing goal-pick → tour-creation-dialog flow; if the user is not authenticated the Add-tour segment SHALL render disabled with an explanatory tooltip.

#### Scenario: My Tours segment opens tour list

- **WHEN** the user activates the My Tours segment while the bar is enabled
- **THEN** the page SHALL open the tour list overlay (`activeOverlay = 'tours'`)
- **AND** any previously active overlay SHALL close per the single-active-overlay policy

#### Scenario: Add-tour segment starts pick flow

- **WHEN** the user activates the Add-tour segment while authenticated and the bar is enabled
- **THEN** `mapStore.setPickingLocation(true)` SHALL be called
- **AND** the existing location picker SHALL appear over the map

#### Scenario: Add tour disabled when unauthenticated

- **WHEN** the user is not authenticated
- **THEN** the Add-tour segment SHALL render disabled with the existing `signInToAddToursTooltip` text

### Requirement: Single active top-level interaction

While any overlay is active, all FABs not part of that overlay SHALL be disabled or hidden so that only one top-level interaction is reachable at a time. This SHALL apply to: the bottom-center tour action bar, the speed-dial trigger, and the speed-dial menu entries.

#### Scenario: Speed-dial disabled when overlay open

- **WHEN** any overlay (`feedback`, `profile`, `contacts`, `friend-requests`, `tours`, `tour`, `tour-creation`) is active
- **THEN** the speed-dial trigger SHALL render in a disabled state
- **AND** tapping the trigger SHALL close the active overlay without opening the speed-dial menu

#### Scenario: Compass FAB unaffected

- **WHEN** any overlay is active
- **THEN** the compass FAB SHALL retain its existing behaviour (visible when bearing is non-zero, click resets bearing) and SHALL NOT be disabled
