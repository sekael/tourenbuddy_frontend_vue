## Purpose

Mark a tour as completed, record completion metadata, and surface a completed state in lists and detail views.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Tour completion persistence

The tour entity, Zod schema, and Supabase-backed repository SHALL persist a `completed` boolean field per tour. Default value SHALL be `false` for tours without an explicit value.

#### Scenario: Existing tour defaults to not completed

- **WHEN** a tour row is fetched from Supabase with no `completed` column value
- **THEN** the parsed tour domain entity SHALL have `completed === false`

#### Scenario: Completed tour round-trips

- **WHEN** a tour row has `completed = true` in Supabase
- **THEN** the parsed tour domain entity SHALL have `completed === true`

### Requirement: Owner-only completion updates

Only the owner of a tour SHALL be able to change its `completed` field. Enforcement SHALL be server-side via existing Supabase RLS on the `tours` table (owner-only update policy); the UI SHALL also hide or disable the toggle control for non-owners.

#### Scenario: Non-owner update rejected by RLS

- **WHEN** a non-owner client attempts to update the `completed` field of a tour
- **THEN** Supabase RLS SHALL reject the update

#### Scenario: Owner can mark and unmark

- **WHEN** the authenticated user owns the tour
- **THEN** they SHALL be permitted to set `completed` to either `true` or `false` any number of times

### Requirement: Debug-only logging of completion toggles

Completion toggle actions SHALL be logged at debug level via the `useLogger` composable. No `info`, `warn`, or user-visible console output SHALL be emitted for successful toggles.

#### Scenario: Debug log on toggle

- **WHEN** `setCompleted` is invoked
- **THEN** a debug-level log entry SHALL be emitted including the tour id and new value
- **AND** no higher-severity log SHALL be emitted on success

### Requirement: Tour completion toggle action

The tours Pinia store SHALL expose an action that toggles the `completed` field of a given tour and persists the new value via the tour repository.

#### Scenario: Mark tour completed

- **WHEN** `setCompleted(tourId, true)` is invoked on the tours store for a tour currently not completed
- **THEN** the store's local tour record SHALL immediately reflect `completed === true`
- **AND** the repository update SHALL be called with the new value
- **AND** on success the local state SHALL remain set to `true`

#### Scenario: Unmark completed tour

- **WHEN** `setCompleted(tourId, false)` is invoked on a tour currently marked completed
- **THEN** the store's local tour record SHALL immediately reflect `completed === false`
- **AND** the repository update SHALL be called with `false`

#### Scenario: Repository failure rolls back

- **WHEN** the repository update rejects with an error
- **THEN** the store SHALL revert the tour's `completed` field to its previous value
- **AND** the store's `error` ref SHALL be populated with the failure

### Requirement: Completed tour marker visual distinction

The map SHALL render completed tours with a visually distinct marker compared to not-completed tours of the same type. The primary encoding SHALL be a check glyph rendered on top of the tour's colored circle. If a check glyph layer is not feasible in the current MapLibre setup, completed tours SHALL instead render the circle color as a grayscale mix of the tour-type color. The circle radius and stroke SHALL remain identical to not-completed markers, and clicking a completed marker SHALL behave identically to clicking a not-completed one.

#### Scenario: Completed tour shows check marker

- **WHEN** a tour has `completed === true` and a check-glyph symbol layer is active
- **THEN** the map SHALL render a check glyph centered on the tour's circle marker
- **AND** the circle color SHALL remain the tour-type color

#### Scenario: Completed tour grayscale fallback

- **WHEN** a tour has `completed === true` and the check-glyph layer is not available
- **THEN** the circle marker SHALL render with a grayscale mix of the tour-type color

#### Scenario: Selected completed tour retains highlight and glyph

- **WHEN** a completed tour is the currently selected tour
- **THEN** the selected-state styling (larger radius, white stroke) SHALL apply identically to not-completed selected tours
- **AND** the check glyph SHALL still be rendered on top

#### Scenario: Completed tour click behavior unchanged

- **WHEN** a user clicks a completed tour's marker
- **THEN** the map SHALL fly to the tour location and show the tour info component, identical to a not-completed tour click

#### Scenario: Not-completed tour unaffected

- **WHEN** a tour has `completed === false`
- **THEN** the circle marker SHALL render in the normal tour-type color with no check glyph

#### Scenario: GPX track rendering unchanged

- **WHEN** a completed tour has a GPX track
- **THEN** the track SHALL render with the same style as a not-completed tour's track

### Requirement: Reactive marker update on completion change

The map marker layer SHALL reflect any change to a tour's `completed` field within the same tick as the store update, without requiring a page reload or manual refresh.

#### Scenario: Toggle updates marker immediately

- **WHEN** a user toggles completion on a visible tour via the info sheet
- **THEN** the corresponding map marker SHALL update its visual (check glyph shown/hidden or color desaturation applied/removed) before the user takes any further action
