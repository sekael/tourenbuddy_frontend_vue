## Purpose

Guided first-run flow to capture the minimum profile data required to use the app (display name, locale, phone).

## Requirements

### Requirement: Onboarding page for first-time users

An onboarding page at `/onboarding` SHALL collect first name, last name, and phone number from authenticated users whose profile is incomplete. The page SHALL require authentication (redirect unauthenticated users to home).

#### Scenario: First login redirects to onboarding

- **WHEN** an authenticated user with an incomplete profile navigates to `/map`
- **THEN** the router guard SHALL redirect to `/onboarding`

#### Scenario: Returning user with complete profile skips onboarding

- **WHEN** an authenticated user with a complete profile navigates to `/map`
- **THEN** the router guard SHALL allow navigation to `/map` without redirect

#### Scenario: User who previously skipped onboarding is not redirected

- **WHEN** an authenticated user with an incomplete profile who previously skipped onboarding navigates to `/map`
- **THEN** the router guard SHALL allow navigation to `/map` (skip flag stored in localStorage)

### Requirement: Onboarding form with validation

The onboarding form SHALL validate that first name and last name are non-empty strings. Phone number SHALL be optional but validated as a valid phone format (E.164) when provided.

#### Scenario: Valid form submission

- **WHEN** user fills in first name and last name and submits
- **THEN** the profile store SHALL upsert the profile with provided values and navigate to `/map`

#### Scenario: Form submission with phone number

- **WHEN** user fills in all fields including a phone number and submits
- **THEN** the profile SHALL be saved, phone verification flow SHALL be triggered, and on successful verification the user SHALL be navigated to `/map`

#### Scenario: Invalid form shows errors

- **WHEN** user submits with empty first name or last name
- **THEN** inline validation errors SHALL be displayed for empty required fields

### Requirement: Skip onboarding option

Users SHALL be able to skip the onboarding flow. A skip action SHALL set a `skippedOnboarding` flag in localStorage and navigate to `/map`.

#### Scenario: User skips onboarding

- **WHEN** user clicks "Skip" on the onboarding page
- **THEN** `skippedOnboarding` SHALL be set to `true` in localStorage and user SHALL be navigated to `/map`

#### Scenario: Reminder text displayed

- **WHEN** the onboarding page is displayed
- **THEN** a message SHALL inform users that completing their profile provides the best experience

### Requirement: Router guard for profile completeness

A router `beforeEach` guard SHALL check profile completeness for routes with `requiresCompleteProfile: true` meta.

#### Scenario: Guard redirects incomplete profile

- **WHEN** navigation targets a route with `requiresCompleteProfile: true` AND the user's profile is incomplete AND `skippedOnboarding` is not set in localStorage
- **THEN** the guard SHALL redirect to `/onboarding`

#### Scenario: Guard allows complete profile

- **WHEN** navigation targets a route with `requiresCompleteProfile: true` AND the user's profile is complete
- **THEN** the guard SHALL allow navigation
