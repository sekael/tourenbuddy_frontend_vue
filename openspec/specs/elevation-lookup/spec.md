## Purpose

Resolve elevation in meters for a coordinate via the Swisstopo elevation API.

## Requirements

### Requirement: WGS84 to LV95 coordinate transformation

A utility function `wgs84ToLv95(lng: number, lat: number): { easting: number, northing: number }` SHALL convert WGS84 (EPSG:4326) longitude/latitude to Swiss LV95 (EPSG:2056) easting/northing using the swisstopo approximate polynomial formulas.

#### Scenario: Known reference point conversion

- **WHEN** `wgs84ToLv95(7.43863, 46.95108)` is called (Bern Federal Palace)
- **THEN** the result SHALL be approximately `{ easting: 2600000, northing: 1200000 }` within ±2m accuracy

#### Scenario: Coordinate at Swiss border

- **WHEN** `wgs84ToLv95` is called with coordinates at the edge of Swiss territory
- **THEN** it SHALL return valid LV95 coordinates (no bounds check — the elevation API handles out-of-bounds)

### Requirement: Elevation lookup service

A service SHALL convert WGS84 coordinates to LV95, then query the Swisstopo height API with EPSG:2056 parameters to retrieve elevation. The caller MAY pass an `AbortSignal` to stop waiting.

#### Scenario: Successful elevation retrieval

- **WHEN** `getElevation({ lng, lat })` is called with WGS84 coordinates within Switzerland
- **THEN** the service SHALL convert to LV95 via `wgs84ToLv95`, call `https://api3.geo.admin.ch/rest/services/height?easting={E}&northing={N}&sr=2056`, and return the elevation in meters as a number

#### Scenario: Coordinates outside Switzerland

- **WHEN** `getElevation({ lng, lat })` is called with coordinates outside Swiss territory
- **THEN** the service SHALL return `null` without throwing an error

#### Scenario: API timeout

- **WHEN** the Swisstopo API does not respond within 10 seconds
- **THEN** the service SHALL return `null` and log a warning via the logger composable

#### Scenario: API error

- **WHEN** the Swisstopo API returns an error response
- **THEN** the service SHALL return `null` and log the error

#### Scenario: Caller stops waiting

- **WHEN** the signal passed to `getElevation(coords, signal)` aborts before the API answers
- **THEN** the request SHALL be aborted and the service SHALL return `null` without logging

### Requirement: Elevation auto-fill on location confirm

After the user confirms a map location, the tour form SHALL open at once and look up the elevation for that point's elevation field on its own, independently of the name lookup.

#### Scenario: Elevation loading

- **WHEN** the elevation lookup for a picked point is still running
- **THEN** the elevation field SHALL be empty, show a spinner inside the field, and read "Loading from Swisstopo…" (or its localized equivalent) as its placeholder
- **AND** the name field SHALL fill as soon as its own lookup answers

#### Scenario: Elevation pre-filled

- **WHEN** the elevation lookup succeeds
- **THEN** the elevation field SHALL be filled with the retrieved value and the spinner SHALL disappear
- **AND** the user SHALL be able to manually override the value

#### Scenario: Elevation lookup fails

- **WHEN** the elevation lookup returns null (timeout, API error, outside Switzerland)
- **THEN** the elevation field SHALL stay empty with the placeholder "Not available from Swisstopo – enter manually" (or its localized equivalent)

#### Scenario: User types while the lookup runs

- **WHEN** the user types in the elevation field before the lookup answers
- **THEN** the spinner SHALL disappear, the request SHALL be aborted, and no later answer SHALL replace the typed value

#### Scenario: Re-pick keeps a typed elevation

- **WHEN** the user has typed an elevation and then re-picks the point
- **THEN** no elevation lookup SHALL run for that field and the typed value SHALL stay
- **AND** an elevation the form filled itself or was opened with SHALL be replaced by the new point's lookup
