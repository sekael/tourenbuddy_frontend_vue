## Purpose

Slide-out navigation and account drawer anchored to the side of the viewport.

## Requirements

### Requirement: SideDrawer component renders as a right-edge panel

The `SideDrawer` component SHALL render as a panel anchored to the right edge of the viewport on desktop viewports (>=600px). On mobile viewports (<600px), the `SideDrawer` SHALL render as a bottom sheet using the existing `BottomSheet` component, preserving the mobile experience unchanged.

#### Scenario: Desktop drawer appearance

- **WHEN** the viewport width is at or above 600px
- **AND** a `SideDrawer` component is rendered
- **THEN** the drawer SHALL be anchored to the right edge of the viewport
- **AND** the drawer SHALL span the full viewport height
- **AND** the drawer SHALL have a fixed width of 400px
- **AND** the drawer SHALL have a left border for visual separation from the map

#### Scenario: Mobile fallback to bottom sheet

- **WHEN** the viewport width is below 600px
- **AND** a `SideDrawer` component is rendered
- **THEN** the component SHALL render using the `BottomSheet` component
- **AND** the mobile behavior SHALL be identical to a standard `BottomSheet`

### Requirement: SideDrawer slide-in animation

The `SideDrawer` SHALL animate in from the right edge on desktop with a horizontal slide transition.

#### Scenario: Desktop slide-in animation

- **WHEN** a `SideDrawer` enters the DOM on a viewport at or above 600px
- **THEN** it SHALL animate in with a `translateX(100%)` to `translateX(0)` slide-right-to-left transition
- **AND** when leaving, it SHALL animate out with a `translateX(0)` to `translateX(100%)` slide-left-to-right transition

#### Scenario: Mobile slide-up animation unchanged

- **WHEN** a `SideDrawer` enters the DOM on a viewport below 600px
- **THEN** it SHALL use the standard `BottomSheet` slide-up transition

### Requirement: SideDrawer API contract

The `SideDrawer` component SHALL accept the same props as `BottomSheet` (`title?: string`, `ariaLabel?: string`), emit a `close` event, and provide a default slot for content.

#### Scenario: Props and emits match BottomSheet

- **WHEN** a `SideDrawer` is instantiated
- **THEN** it SHALL accept `title?: string` and `ariaLabel?: string` props
- **AND** it SHALL emit `close` when the close button is clicked
- **AND** it SHALL provide a default slot for content

### Requirement: SideDrawer does not render a backdrop on desktop

On desktop, the `SideDrawer` SHALL NOT render a semi-transparent backdrop scrim because the drawer is designed to coexist with the visible map. The map background click mechanism in `map-page.vue` handles dismissal.

#### Scenario: No backdrop on desktop

- **WHEN** the viewport width is at or above 600px
- **AND** a `SideDrawer` is rendered
- **THEN** no backdrop or scrim element SHALL be displayed behind the drawer

#### Scenario: Dismiss via map background click

- **WHEN** a `SideDrawer` is open on desktop
- **AND** the user clicks on the map background outside the drawer
- **THEN** the parent page SHALL close the drawer via the existing map-background-click mechanism

### Requirement: SideDrawer supports a collapsed header-only mode

The `SideDrawer` component SHALL accept a `collapsed: boolean` prop. When `collapsed` is true, the drawer SHALL render only a compact header showing its `title` (for example, "Edit: Uri Rotstock") and SHALL hide its default slot, its close button, and any drag handle. Dismissal via map-background click, backdrop click, or the Escape key SHALL be suppressed while `collapsed` is true. When `collapsed` becomes false, the drawer SHALL restore its full body and dismissal affordances without losing any slot content state.

#### Scenario: Desktop collapsed header placement

- **WHEN** the viewport width is at or above 600px
- **AND** a `SideDrawer` is rendered with `collapsed: true` and `title: "Edit: Uri Rotstock"`
- **THEN** the drawer SHALL render as a compact header in the top-right corner showing the title
- **AND** the drawer SHALL NOT render its default slot content
- **AND** the drawer SHALL NOT render a close button
- **AND** clicking the map background SHALL NOT close the drawer

#### Scenario: Mobile collapsed bottom sheet

- **WHEN** the viewport width is below 600px
- **AND** a `SideDrawer` is rendered with `collapsed: true`
- **THEN** the underlying `BottomSheet` SHALL render only a title-only header
- **AND** the sheet SHALL NOT render a close button
- **AND** the sheet SHALL NOT render a drag handle
- **AND** clicking the backdrop or map background SHALL NOT close the sheet
- **AND** pressing Escape SHALL NOT close the sheet

#### Scenario: Slot state preserved across collapse toggle

- **WHEN** a `SideDrawer` is toggled from `collapsed: false` to `collapsed: true` and back to `collapsed: false`
- **THEN** the slot content SHALL remain mounted throughout
- **AND** any in-progress Vue state inside the slot (for example, form input values) SHALL be preserved

### Requirement: Drawer scroll region reserves scrollbar gutter

The scrollable content region of `SideDrawer` SHALL reserve space for the scrollbar so the scrollbar never overlaps content. Scrollbar SHALL render with a thin, app-consistent style.

#### Scenario: Drawer content overflows on desktop
- **WHEN** drawer content overflows in a browser that honors `scrollbar-gutter`
- **THEN** a scrollbar gutter SHALL be reserved on the inline-end side
- **AND** content SHALL NOT shift horizontally when the scrollbar appears or disappears

#### Scenario: Drawer content overflows on mobile
- **WHEN** drawer content overflows in a browser using overlay scrollbars
- **THEN** the overlay scrollbar SHALL sit over reserved right padding inside the content region and SHALL NOT overlap interactive controls

### Requirement: Drawer content scroll is contained

The scrollable content region of `SideDrawer` SHALL contain its scroll: when scrolled past
either end, the scroll SHALL NOT chain to any ancestor — not the page behind the drawer,
not the document, and not a map rendered beside or beneath it. The region's own
end-of-scroll affordance (rubber-band on platforms that provide one) SHALL be preserved.

Containment SHALL apply to the drawer's own scroll region only. It SHALL NOT affect input
directed at surfaces outside the drawer: while a drawer is open, the portion of the map
still visible SHALL remain fully interactive (see `map-integration`).

#### Scenario: Overscrolling the drawer does not move the page behind it

- **WHEN** the drawer content is scrolled to its top or bottom edge
- **AND** the user continues the scroll gesture in the same direction
- **THEN** no ancestor scroll container SHALL scroll
- **AND** the document scroll offset SHALL remain unchanged

#### Scenario: Map stays zoomable next to an open drawer

- **WHEN** a side drawer is open over part of the map
- **AND** the user scroll-wheels or pinches over the still-visible portion of the map
- **THEN** the map SHALL zoom
- **AND** the drawer's scroll position SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement: Drawer content scrolls vertically only

The drawer's scrollable content region SHALL scroll on the vertical axis only, regardless
of child content width.

#### Scenario: Horizontal swipe over the drawer content does nothing

- **WHEN** the user swipes or drags horizontally within the drawer content region
- **THEN** the drawer content SHALL NOT scroll horizontally
